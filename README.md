Homework created using react-create-app

Download and install dependencies using npm install command

At App.js you can see ChessBoard ProductsList SingleProduct PrivateAccount components.
It's a tasks. I did not do routings. Therefore, to see the tasks you need to uncomment the components in turn.



Thank you.
